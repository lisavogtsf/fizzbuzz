#fizzbuzz
========
A tiny c program that prints fizz on multiples of 3, buzz on multiples of 5 and fizz buzz on multiples of both. I made this to confirm to myself that this simple usage of a for loop and if statements would be sufficient without creating a special case for multiples of 3 and 5.

Change the value of TIMES, which is #define-d in the fizzbuzz.c file to change how many numbers the program runs on.

Currently not working outside my virtual machine. bash says "cannot execute binary file"
